# CogStack-TR
A browser based GUI to support patient recruitments by utilising CogStack and SemEHR functionalities. CogStack-TR is designed to enable:
- easy and automated construction of inclusion/exclusion queries based on textural trial specifications
- efficient and accurate matching of patients based on both structured and unstructured EHR records
- semantic computation to allow intelligent criteria relaxation when required

An online demo system is available [here](http://napeasy.org/prui/).
